#Q4(i)

# One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is inappropriate to use in evaluating
# whether the exercise can alleviate depression since the one-way ANOVA is
# merely appropriate to be used when the dependent variable is a continuous
# variable. However, the Likert scale score is classified as an ordinal-level
# scale, hence the Kruskal-Wallis H test is more appropriate to be used.

kruskal.test(data, level)

# Based on the results of the analysis acquired from Kruskal-Wallis H test,
# there is a statistically significant difference that the exercise can
# alleviate depression since (P-value=0.02612) < (a=0.05).

# A post-doc analysis, such as Dunnâ€™s test can be carried out to identify which
# exercise can alleviate depression.
